This is an analysis of Denver's crime data. Denver makes it's crime data publicly available at this link: https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-crime. I have analyzed the data and written a report/presentation describing my findings. I've included the code as an ipynb, the report as a pdf, and the slidedeck as a pptx. I hope you find this analysis useful. Please reach out to me at neil.s.oza@gmail.com for clarifications and have a great day!
